# Password Generator

## Description
A password generator was built in order to generate random passwords containing a multiple combination of characters in order to make it easier for the user to 
come up with safe passwords instead of re-using the same password and risking the safety of their accounts. 
This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I was able to work on the logic behind the password generator so that it is able to create a unique password 
each time it is used. Using JavaScript to create the logic behind the password generator helped me utilize the fundamental concepts learned in-class such as the use of loops, functions, arrays, and it also pushed me to learn about these concepts further to fully understand them and utilize them all together. It also helped me by forcing me to think outside of the box and brainstorm possible solutions to problems by writing notes or drawing charts to visualize my ideas before turning them into code. 

## Usage
To use the password generator [Click Here!](https://renfunny.github.io/password-generator/) The password generator is very simple to use, first you will need to click on the "Generate Password" button, then you will be asked how long the password should be where you'll be able to choose between a minimum length of 8 characters to a maximum length of 128 characters. After the length has been submitted you will be asked what type of characters you would like the password to include, these include; lower case, upper case, numeric, and special characters. Once the criteria of the password has been chosen the password generator will get to work and generate a beautiful unique password for the user to use.

## How to Contribute
The application is finished but if you'd like to review the logic behind the password generator and suggest other ways it can be done I would be more than happy to read all your suggestions and learn from them!
